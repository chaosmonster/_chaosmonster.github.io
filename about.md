I am Martin a software developer from Berlin. In the past I worked as a backend developer with PHP and Java. While working for a small startup (that creates software for the event/ concert industry) I switched to the frontend and started as a javascript developer working with Angularjs (1.0.7).  
Today I'm working for [Idealo](idealo.de) as an [Angular](https://angular.io) and Java developer.  
I am also a co-organizer of the [Angular-Meetup-Berlin](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/AngularJS-Meetup-Berlin/) so if you are in the city come and join.

Last but least my avatar may give a hint: I am more of a cat person ðŸ˜¸.
